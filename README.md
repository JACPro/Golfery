# Golfery

Over a period of 48 hours, I developed a silly web game about shooting targets at arrows for the [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023). It's a short but fun prototype that serves as a polished proof of concept. Your score is based on a mix of which ring of the target hits the arrow, and the total number of shots over or under par it takes to complete the level.

These are a selection of some of the scripts I wrote for the Game Jam:
* [Aim, Draw Trajectory, and Fire]()
* [Audio Manager]()
* [Input Manager using the "New" Input System]() 
* [Handling UI events with the observer pattern]()
* [Dashed Line Shader]()
* [Wobbly TextMeshPro Letters]()
* [Scene Manager]()
* [Score Manager]()
* [Pause Manager]()
